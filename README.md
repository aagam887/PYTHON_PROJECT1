This Python code utilizes the pandas library to load hotel data from an Excel file and allows users to search for hotels based on their preferred location and price range. It defines a function to process the 'Cost' column, converting any range of costs into a numerical average and cleaning up the data by removing commas and whitespace. Users are prompted to select a state, and upon choosing a valid state, they can view the available cities and specify a city along with a minimum and maximum price range. The code then filters the hotel data according to these inputs, displaying any matching hotels sorted by cost. If no hotels fit the criteria, the user is informed. Overall, the code provides a user-friendly interface for searching hotel options tailored to individual preferences.
